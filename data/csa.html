(Community Supported Agriculture)</b><br />A CSA is a win-win partnership between the farmer and the eater.  The farmer sells shares in the upcoming season’s produce to individuals and families.  Shareholders receive an amazing variety of fresh, organically grown, seasonal vegetables every week throughout the growing season.  Your food is grown locally by a farmer you know and trust.    The farmer has a guaranteed market for her produce and can therefore focus on producing high quality food.</p><p><b>What do I get in my share?</b><br />The following list of vegetables is an example of what last years’ shareholders received: Arugula, Asian greens, basil, beans, beets, bok choi, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, chard, cucumbers, fava beans, fennel, garlic, garlic scapes, herbs, kale, kohlrabi, leeks, lettuce and salad mix, onions, peas, pea shoots, peppers, potatoes, pumpkins, radish, raspberries, spinach, squash - summer & winter, sunchokes, strawberries, tomatoes, turnips. Offerings are subject to change each season.</p><p><b>What is a share?</b><br />With all the variety, this is a program for people who love vegetables and who like to cook. The share size will amply feed 2-4 people.    You will receive 8-12 produce items per week. Shares may be a bit lighter at the start of the season and heavier when more crops are on mid-season.  It will average out to be a great value for your money. When you become a shareholder, you are making a commitment for the full season.</p><p>f you are a single person and a full share would be too much, we encourage you to split a share with a friend or neighbor. We do not offer smaller sized shares but may be able to assist in matching people up.</p><p><b>How much does a share cost?</b><br />The price for a share in the 2016 season is $600. The season will run for 20 weeks, beginning the first full week of June and ending the third week of October (an average of $30.00/week). You may secure a spot by either making a full payment or with a deposit of $100 followed by two $250 installments on March 31st and May 31st.  You must be paid in full by the first produce pick-up day. We will work with you on alternative payment plans as needed.</p><p><b>How do I get my share?</b><br />You may choose one of two pick-up days - Tuesday or Friday. Vegetable shares will be available for pick up on your designated day from noon to 6 pm at the Rosehip farm stand. As we have limited refrigeration, you must pick up your share within 24 hours or it will be donated to the food bank.  If you are going to be away, we encourage you to give your share to a friend.</p><p>Contact us at the address below.</p><div class="center"><img src="../images/csaicechest.jpg" width="900" hieght="518" border="0" alt="CSA group" /></div></div><div id="footer"><h4 class="center">RoseHip Farm &amp; Garden<br />338 Fort Casey Road<br />Coupeville, WA 98239<br />Ph.
